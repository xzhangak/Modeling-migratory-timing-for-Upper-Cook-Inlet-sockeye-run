# Modeling migratory timing for Upper Cook Inlet sockeye run using R 
For the southern OTF, the sockeye salmon run was described for each of the previous years based on the respective test fishing data, as described in Mundy (1979): 
model: y = 1/(1+exp(-a - b*d)) where a and b are model parameters. 
For the details, see Mundy (1979) and ADFG report (e.g. Aaron Dupuis and Mark Willette 2016 Report)
It is the same as old FORTRAN program: O F F S H O R E   T E S T   F I S H I N G N 0 N - L I N E A R   C U R V E   F I T   P R O G R A M 
The model output information is to update an input file NLINCOEF for UCI sockeye inseason estimates model
